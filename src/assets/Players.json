        "Marc-André ter Stegen signed for FC Barcelona in the summer of 2014 from Borussia Mönchengladbach. Born on 30 April 1992 in Mönchengladbach itself, the German did not take long to make his name as one Europe’s most promising young goalkeepers.",
        "His only previous club was Borussia Mönchengladbach, which he joined in 1996 at the age of just 4, and by the time he was 18 he had already made his first team debut on 10 April 2011 in the Bundesliga against FC Köln. Mönchengladbach won 5-1, and following a fine performance Ter Stegen was soon the regular first choice keeper, conceding just three goals in his first six outings.",
        "In the next two games, Ter Stegen and Mönchengladbach faced a relegation playoff, and won 2-1 on aggregate to stay in the top division. The following season, Ter Stegen was named best goalkeeper in the Bundesliga and he went on to complete four seasons and 108 matches in the German league.",
        "Ter Stegen made his official debut for the Club on 17 September 2014 in Champions League against APOEL Nicosia FC. The match ended with a Barça victory (1-0 ). Aged just 22 years he became the second German goalkeeper at FC Barcelona, following on from Robert Enke. In his debut season, 2014/15, the goalkeeper played every game in the Champions League and had a leading role in the Copa del Rey, both of which Barça won. In La Liga he was back up to Claudio Bravo in his first couple of seasons at the Club but with the departure of the Chilean, Ter Stegen became first choice also in the league in the 2016/17 season.",
        "Consistency is one of the key characteristics of the German keeper and in the 2021/22 season he surpassed 300 games for Barça, taking him into the top 5 on the all time appearance list for foreign players.",
        "The 2022/23 season was a memorable one for the goalkeeper from Mönchengladbach. Ter Stegen won his first Zamora trophy after conceding just 18 goals in the league, keeping 26 clean sheets to equal Deportivo La Coruña's Paco Liaño whose record was set back in 1993/94. The German's performances were key in Barça reclaiming the league title and winning another Spanish Super Cup to add to their collection.",
        "The goalkeeper from Möchengladbach has gone from one success to another and as a player he has so far won no less than 16 trophies with Barça.",
        "International with Germany since the summer of 2017 Ter Stegen was key in his national side's victory in the Confederations Cup and the goalkeeper was named man of the match in the final against Chile. He was also part of the German squad in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups."

        "In August 2006 Flick became assistant coach to Jürgen Löw at the German national team following the resignation of Jürgen Klinsmann. Löw and Flick led Germany through a rebuilding phase and then to the final of the European Championships in 2008.",
        "In 2010 the team reached the World Cup semi-final, the same stage of the European Championships in 2012 before being crowned World Champions in 2014 in Brazil.",
        "Six trophies",
        "After the success in the tournament, Flick stepped down as assistant coach to the ‘Mannschaft’ and took a job as sporting director at the German Football Federation (DFB) before returning to Hoffenheim in 2017 as sporting director. In the summer of 2019 Flick arrived at Bayern Munich as assistant to Nico Kovac.",
        "The Bavarian club went on to sack their Croatian coach after just months in the job and Flick was promoted to caretaker first team coach, a decision that was to change the course of Bayern’s history. After a good start, Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed Flick in the job until the end of the season. Flick recorded 22 wins in his first 25 games in charge, surpassing Josep Guardiola’s figures of 21 wins in his first 25 matches.",
        "After winning the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League, Bayern completed the set with victory in the German Super Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup, repeating the feat achieved by Pep Guardiola’s Barça in 2009.",
        "In the 2020/21 season Bayern retained the league title before the coach informed the club he would be leaving to take on the German national team, a job he retained until September 2023."
