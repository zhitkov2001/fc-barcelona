        "His only previous club was Borussia Mönchengladbach, which he joined in 1996 at the age of just 4, and by the time he was 18 he had already made his first team debut on 10 April 2011 in the Bundesliga against FC Köln. Mönchengladbach won 5-1, and following a fine performance Ter Stegen was soon the regular first choice keeper, conceding just three goals in his first six outings.",
        "In the next two games, Ter Stegen and Mönchengladbach faced a relegation playoff, and won 2-1 on aggregate to stay in the top division. The following season, Ter Stegen was named best goalkeeper in the Bundesliga and he went on to complete four seasons and 108 matches in the German league.",
        "Ter Stegen made his official debut for the Club on 17 September 2014 in Champions League against APOEL Nicosia FC. The match ended with a Barça victory (1-0 ). Aged just 22 years he became the second German goalkeeper at FC Barcelona, following on from Robert Enke. In his debut season, 2014/15, the goalkeeper played every game in the Champions League and had a leading role in the Copa del Rey, both of which Barça won. In La Liga he was back up to Claudio Bravo in his first couple of seasons at the Club but with the departure of the Chilean, Ter Stegen became first choice also in the league in the 2016/17 season.",
        "Consistency is one of the key characteristics of the German keeper and in the 2021/22 season he surpassed 300 games for Barça, taking him into the top 5 on the all time appearance list for foreign players.",
        "The 2022/23 season was a memorable one for the goalkeeper from Mönchengladbach. Ter Stegen won his first Zamora trophy after conceding just 18 goals in the league, keeping 26 clean sheets to equal Deportivo La Coruña's Paco Liaño whose record was set back in 1993/94. The German's performances were key in Barça reclaiming the league title and winning another Spanish Super Cup to add to their collection.",
        "The goalkeeper from Möchengladbach has gone from one success to another and as a player he has so far won no less than 16 trophies with Barça.",
        "International with Germany since the summer of 2017 Ter Stegen was key in his national side's victory in the Confederations Cup and the goalkeeper was named man of the match in the final against Chile. He was also part of the German squad in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups."

        "As a blaugrana, Kounde was key in helping Barça to the Spanish Super Cup and La Liga titles in 2022/23. The Frenchman showed his versatility by playing mainly at right back in his first season at Barça. His first goal for the Club came against Espanyol in the match that sealed the league for FC Barcelona in May 2023.",
        "Jules Kounde is known for being a very fast defender, quick to intercept, and being good on the ball. The French centre back, who can also play as a full back, is very difficult to beat one-on-one and is comfortable defending high up the pitch, as he trusts his recovery pace to get back."
